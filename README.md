# Final-Project-COMP9001
Designed by Sicong Liu
This 24-point game program challenges players to combine four randomly drawn cards (with values A=1, 2-10, J=11, Q=12, K=13) using arithmetic operations (+ - * /) and parentheses to reach the target number 24. The program features a card visualization system that displays the drawn cards in an ASCII-art style layout (e.g., ♠A or ♥10), and includes a solver that generates all valid solutions by exhaustively testing permutations of numbers and operator combinations with different parenthetical groupings. Players can input their solutions for validation, request hints when stuck, or quit mid-game. The game tracks success rates across multiple rounds and handles edge cases like division by zero or invalid expressions. Behind the scenes, it uses Fisher-Yates shuffling for card randomization and evaluates expressions safely with floating-point tolerance checks for the target value.
